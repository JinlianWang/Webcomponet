# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/helloworld.jsx` defines `HelloWorldElement` (and nested pieces like `Calendar`); `src/main.jsx` simply imports it so Vite can include the element in the bundle.
- `src/index.html` is the Vite entry document rendered by both the dev server and the production build.
- `dist/` is generated by Vite (`npm run build`) and contains the processed `index.html` plus hashed assets under `dist/assets/`; never edit files there manually.
- Keep additional assets inside `src/` so they flow through Vite's pipeline; `node_modules/` remains untracked.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` installs React, ReactDOM, Vite, and the React plugin.
- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server with hot reload on `src/index.html`.
- `npm run build` outputs the production bundle to `dist/` (hashing filenames, clearing old builds).
- `npm run preview` serves the contents of `dist/` using Vite's preview server.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use modern React with functional components and hooks; favor JSX files using 2-space indentation and semicolons.
- Web Components should be registered with lowercase, dashed names (e.g., `hello-react`) and exported from their own modules.
- Keep inline styles minimal; prefer CSS files imported near the component root when styles grow.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated tests exist yet. When adding them, place React-focused tests under `src/__tests__/` and use a lightweight runner such as Vitest or Jest.
- Name test files `*.test.jsx` and ensure each covers the lifecycle of the custom element (mount, update, disconnect).
- Gate pull requests on `npm run test` once a script is added and target at least smoke-level coverage of new components.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow a concise Conventional Commits style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) so the changelog remains readable.
- Reference related issues in the body, describe user-visible behavior, and include screenshots or terminal output when UI/CLI behavior changes.
- PRs should explain build/test steps run locally and call out any new dependencies or manual migration steps for reviewers.
