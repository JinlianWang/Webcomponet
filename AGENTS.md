# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/helloworld.jsx` defines the `HelloWorldElement` Web Component that wraps the React view; `src/index.html` bootstraps the demo page.
- `dist/` is generated by the build and contains `bundle.js` plus a copied `index.html`; do not edit files there manually.
- `node_modules/` is managed by npm; never commit its contents. Keep additional assets inside `src/` so esbuild can reach them.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` installs React, ReactDOM, esbuild, and the `serve` dev server.
- `npm run build` bundles `src/helloworld.jsx` into `dist/bundle.js` and copies `src/index.html` into `dist/`.
- `npm run serve` serves the `dist/` folder for manual testing; rerun `npm run build` before serving if source changed.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use modern React with functional components and hooks; favor JSX files using 2-space indentation and semicolons.
- Web Components should be registered with lowercase, dashed names (e.g., `hello-react`) and exported from their own modules.
- Keep inline styles minimal; prefer CSS files imported near the component root when styles grow.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated tests exist yet. When adding them, place React-focused tests under `src/__tests__/` and use a lightweight runner such as Vitest or Jest.
- Name test files `*.test.jsx` and ensure each covers the lifecycle of the custom element (mount, update, disconnect).
- Gate pull requests on `npm run test` once a script is added and target at least smoke-level coverage of new components.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow a concise Conventional Commits style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) so the changelog remains readable.
- Reference related issues in the body, describe user-visible behavior, and include screenshots or terminal output when UI/CLI behavior changes.
- PRs should explain build/test steps run locally and call out any new dependencies or manual migration steps for reviewers.
